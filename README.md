# [Food Diary](https://suspicious-hermann-9a8492.netlify.app/)
This is a code-along project from Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript Course. This apps easily allows you to track your meals and calories for the day. First, you enter your food item and it's calories. Then, a list is then created and the total calories clearly displayed on the screen for easy tracking. You can also edit and delete items from your list. Local storage is used to persist date. The Materialize framework is used for the UI and it was designed to be mobile friendly.
