# Project Link: [Food Diary](https://suspicious-hermann-9a8492.netlify.app/)
This is a code-along project from Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript Course. This apps easily allows you to track your meals and calories for the day. 
First, you enter your food item and it's calories. The item and calories persist using the browser’s local storage and are displayed on screen in a list. You’re able to add, delete, and edit food items and calories. There is a running total so you can easily see the total calories consumed. This app was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Materialize CSS. The functionality is primarily achieved with DOM manipulation, CRUD principles, and event handling using vanilla JS.
