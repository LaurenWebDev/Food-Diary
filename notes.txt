local storage to persist data

we will use different module controllers
-local storage (last)
-item controllers
-ui, state- edit state, delete, clear
-main app

when we add an item, we need a constructor so then we can add it to the state

how to disable enter
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(e){
    //check to see if enter was hit
      if(e.keyCode === 13 || e.which === 13) {
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
      }

problem- fixed
-pressing back to clear edit state reloads the page, line 240is
-may need to set a new function to prevent default

Notes* Item, UI name and define the functions, App make them happen/execute
So we have a set of functions (stuff we need to happen on the page), we organize them by what they do/ctrl, everything comes together in the app
